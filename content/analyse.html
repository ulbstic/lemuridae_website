<h1>What does analyse mean?</h1>

<p>What we call analyse means construct a knowledge representation that reflects a certain reality for a sector or an organisation. This representation can be called <b>knowledge organisation systems</b> (KOS) — it is a very wide concept that includes authority lists, classification systems, controlled vocabularies, filing plan, relational database scheme, ontologies, etc. In a certain way, even a share drive's directory structure is a KOS!</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Every time we build an information system, we begin by sketching the outlines of the knowledge field related to the organisation in witch this system will be implemented. This step is a necessary requirement, just as well as nobody builds a house without starting with a construction plan.</p>

<p>In addition, information systems are increasingly interconnected and standards can play the role of interoperability facilitator. Records management standards — such as ISO 15489 and MoReq2010 — recommend the use of filing plans, i.e. a knowledge organisation system.</p>

<H2>How?</H2>

<p>Developing and managing a classification plan are time-consuming tasks which require a large amount of resources. Since these tasks have no directly perceptible benefits, organisations tend to allocate them little funding.</p>

<p>Automation could be a way to reduce the financing costs of filing plan management.
But the point is that building and using a classification scheme requires a detailed human analysis; so making it automated is undoubtedly a very complex task.</p>

<p>However,  on the one hand, the natural language processing research area has made great leap forwards towards information extraction from textual data; and the information needed to develop classification plans can be found, most of the time, within textual documents. On the other hand, automated classification systems based on textual features extraction and machine learning algorithms are beginning to achieve outstanding results. Gartner predicts that those technologies will reach their maturity peak within two years.</p>
